# Diabetes-EDA-Feature_Engineering-ML-HPT
I performed an extensive data analysis on the diabetes dataset, covering EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Feature Engineering, ML (Machine Learning), and HPT (Hyperparameter Tuning) processes.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In the project, the first step was to perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). During this stage, information about the dataset was gathered, missing data was checked, and erroneous data entries were corrected. It was observed that all identified erroneous data entries were entered as "0," and data preprocessing was performed to handle this issue.

After completing the data preprocessing, outlier detection was performed on the dataset. The features in the dataset were visualized and examined. Separate data visualization and analysis were conducted on the target variable, "Outcome." Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between the variables.

OUTLIER DETECTION

Data was made more robust by using the method of data capping on the features where outlier detection was performed.

FEATURE ENGINEERING

New features were discovered and extracted from the dataset through feature engineering, and they were included in the dataset.

ML - MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning algorithms such as Logistcic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, SVM (support vector machine), and KNN (k-nearest neighbors) were used.
