# Diabetes-EDA-Feature_Engineering-ML-HPT
I performed an extensive data analysis on the diabetes dataset, covering EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Feature Engineering, ML (Machine Learning), and HPT (Hyperparameter Tuning) processes.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In the project, the first step was to perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). During this stage, information about the dataset was gathered, missing data was checked, and erroneous data entries were corrected. It was observed that all identified erroneous data entries were entered as "0," and data preprocessing was performed to handle this issue.
